Lua bindings

Lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed for extending
applications. It provides a good general purpose programming language to
replace DSL that don't really need to be specific.

This library provides bindings to Lua API which allows the application to
exchange data with Lua programs and also to extend Lua with C functions.
